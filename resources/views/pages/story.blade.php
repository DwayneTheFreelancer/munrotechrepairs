        <p>Breaking your phone can be caused by an accident or from over time use of your phone. Its a feeling of total sadness, anger, and frustration especially to look at. I remembered when I first cracked my Iphone I was in the 10th grade, I felt just like how you did, even worse I had a screen protector on and the real screen was crack but the screen protector was perfectly fine. After being depressed looking at the screen every time I looked used my phone I decided to go to one of those phone repair companies to get it fixed. When I went into the store and asked the guy how much do you fix the Iphone 6s plus for he said $215 with tax. Now that is a ridiculous amount of money to charge to fix a phone even though it was the lastest phone during that time. As the years went by I realized breaking your phone was a common thing and when I ask people why people don't you go get your phone fixed all of their answers are the same, "The person at the store charge too high". So they end up wasting money on a new phone when all they needed was a new screen or battery. One day I was in history class with my friend Jason and he cracked his phone who complained about the same thing so I thought of a way I can fix people phones with better customer service and prices so people can save a lot of money. That same night I started working on building the website, talked about it to people I know about the idea and all of them loved it all I had to do was put my words into action and now here the company is where it is now!</p>
